# Evaluating-predictions-with-other-metrics

### Project Overview
The aim of this exercise is to compute metrics other than accuracy to judge the efficacy of our model's predictions. 

As you will see, the accuracy score for both the kNN and Logistic Regression models is the same, and so accuracy is not always the best metric for classification, especially when there is class imbalance.
